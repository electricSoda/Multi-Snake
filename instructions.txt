Greetings from the Multi-Snake team.
These objectives and instructions are used to educate, not promote violent
thoughts.
Concluding below are the educational pieces to play this game:

Firstly, to control the snake on the right side of the screen, use the
arrow keys to move the snake up, down, left, and right.

To control the snake on the left side of the screen, use W, A, S, D, to
move the snake up, left, down, and right.

Secondly, the objective of this game is to eat the food to grow longer in size,
but avoiding crashing into your teammate (or player 2) henceforth also avoiding
yourself *. Quick Tip: Try not to crash into the edge of the window or screen
(it won't end well). If you/your teammate crashes into the boundaries or crashes
into a snake's segment you both restart!

If you are playing by yourself, just press either the arrow keys, or W, A, S, D
to just start one snake up and moving. If you like challenges, try playing the
game with both the arrow keys and W, A, S, D.

Also, press the escape button to pause the currently running game.

* Don't let your "Head" crash into your "Body"
